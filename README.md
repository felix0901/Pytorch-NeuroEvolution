# Pytorch-NeuroEvolution
* The Environment is adopted from [this implementation]( https://github.com/alirezamika/evostra), which uses evolution strategy.
* In this project we implemented a Pytorch version of [DeepNeuroevolution](https://eng.uber.com/research/deep-neuroevolution-genetic-algorithms-are-a-competitive-alternative-for-training-deep-neural-networks-for-reinforcement-learning/)

# Setup
```
    pip install -r requirement.txt
```
# Run
```
    cd examples/cartpole 
    python train_pytorch.py
```
